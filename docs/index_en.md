Please reimport model files if you upgrade it from 1.4

### Environment

#### Version

UnrealEngine4.23 or later

#### Compiler

It is necessary to install a compiler suitable for the environment.
For example, you need to install VisualStudio 2017 or 2019 on Windows.

#### Platform

Since platform-specific functions are not used,
EffekseerForUnrealEngine4 works on most platforms.


## Constitution

EffekseerForUE4 consists mainly of two components.

It is ```EffekseerSystemComponent``` and ```EffekseerEmitterComponent```.

EffekseerSystem draws effects. Therefore, one component is absolutely necessary within the level.

EffekseerEmitterComponent creates and manipulates effects. It is necessary for each effect.

Besides these, theare are ```EffekseerEffect``` asset corresponding to Effekseer's efk file and
```EffekseerModel``` asset corresponding to the Effekseer's efkmdl file.

There are also ```BP_EffekseerSystem``` and ```BP_EffekseerEmitter``` blueprints that makes it easier to use components.

## Sample

``` EffekseerForUE4.uproject ``` contains sample levels.

You can see that Effekseer's effect is being played.

### 2.1. Components of Effekseer

You can also add Effekseer components to other actors.
However, since EffekseerSystem is complicated, we recommend that you only use the EffekseerEmitter component.

### 4.1 Network

* Only Windows

You can edit the playing effect in an application (game etc.) via the network from the outside when application is running.

<img src="img/network.png" width="800">

You specify the port to be connected from Effekseer fo EffekseerSystemComponent. Make DoStartNetworkAutomatically On or execute StartNetwork in EffekseerSystemComponent.
Then you can edit the effect from Effekseer. In order to edit the effect from another computer, it is necessary to open the port with the setting of the firewall.

As a limitation, changes to blends or changes to unused images are not applied.

## Caution

A greyscale image with alpha will display incorrectly.

## Limitation

Subtraction, and distortion are different from Effekseer.

The normal map to the model does not apply.

If a large number of models are drawn, the speed tends to decrease.

Does not support culling settings.

Materials do not have depth ignoring settings.

## Todo

- Match of display of Effekseer and UnrealEngine4 of subtraction, distortion

- Implementation of model normals

- Improved ease of use
